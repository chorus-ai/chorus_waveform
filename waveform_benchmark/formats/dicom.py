# I, II, III, V, aVR are part of general, 32bit, or 12 lead ECG
# pleth is part of arterial pulse oximetry
# resp is part of respiration.   We need 3 files to handle this.

# the max number of sequence element means that we may not be able to chunk within a file?  12 lead ECG is limited to 15 secs.
# sleep EEG is not limited...
# TODO: 1. the list of channels need to be partitioned to multiple files
#   2. multiple series need to be created, each contains a single modality.
#   3. a series then contains a single chunk potentially (e.g. 12 lead ecg).
#   4. so a longer length of data will be split into multiple files in the same series.
#   5. this means files in a series will need to be opened for random access.



# IMPORTANT: look at the specification constraints for different types of waveforms.

# waveforms (dict) contains a waveform record, with keys representing each channel (e.g. ['MLII', 'V5']).
# Each channel contains a dictionary with three keys ('units', 'samples_per_second', 'chunks').
# For example: waveforms['V5'] -> {'units': 'mV', 'samples_per_second': 360, 'chunks': [{'start_time': 0.0, 'end_time': 1805.5555555555557, 'start_sample': 0, 'end_sample': 650000, 'gain': 200.0, 'samples': array([-0.065, -0.065, -0.065, ..., -0.365, -0.335,  0.   ], dtype=float32)}]}

# input waveform assumptions:  a channel will always have same unit and sampling frequency (float).  the gain may change per chunk.  chunks need not be uniform in size or start or end at the same time.
# dicom assumptions:  a mulitplex group contains the multiple channels with the same starting time, frequency and number of samples.  start sample, end time, and end sample are implicit for all channels in the group.
#   each channel can have own unit.  multiplex group can be considered a chunk + channel/frequency unit (????  not sure if this is the best interpretation)
# Our organization:  choices:
#   1. each multiplex group be a chunk+channel
#   2. chunk+frequency (multiple channels)?   If second, we need to pad the short channels, and also some multiplex groups would have more channels (from missing chunks.  harder to search)
#   3. each channel is its own file:  probably like 1. but without the channel mixture so could be faster for 1 channel access. prefer single file, though
#   4. each wave segment is its own file.  1 and 2 still valid questions.  would speed up random access.
#   choose 1.  waveform sequence ordered by time.  compatible with 4.

# TODO: may need to separate channels that are not ECGs in other files.
# TODO: private tags for speeding up metadata access while still maintain compatibility?  this would provide "what do we have", and not necessarily "where is it in the file"
# TODO: compression - in transfer syntax?  likely not standards compliant.
# TODO: random access support?
# DONE: fix the nans...

# data:  channels grouped in to multiplex groups by standard spec.
#        multiplex groups are grouped into instance files
#        each file map to one segment
#        all files are for one set of waves are grouped into a series
#        each series contains a dicomdir
